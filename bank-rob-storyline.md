-- Planning Phase --

Decision System (Limited by $):
- Bank
    Amount of $/points possible
- Getaway car and driver 
    Car stats system: speed and durability
- Partner 
    strength, intellect
    _maybe different decisions pop up with either partner_
- Weapon/Tool
  _I'm really not sure how a weapon choice would play a role_
-- Robbing Phase --

- Intimidation
    Skill check? or by chance based on partner's strength?
- Lock picking
    Skill check
â€¢	

_How about every action takes a certain amount of time to complete? Ex: user has 15 min worth of moves, so intimidation takes 30 sec, lock picking takes 2 minutes_
