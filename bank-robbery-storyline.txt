-- Planning Phase --

Decision System (Limited by $):
- Bank
    Amount of $/points possible
- Getaway car and driver 
    Car stats system: speed and durability
- Partner 
    strength and intimidation, intellect and sneak
    _maybe different decisions pop up with either partner_
- Weapon/Tool
    note: I'm really not sure how a weapon choice would play a role
    Bigger gun: +Intimidation
    Roids: +Strength
    Doohickey usb: +intellect
    Noise Cancellation Boots: +sneak

First Decision: Town Bank (100% Success Rate), Bank of Chase Fargo (75% Success Rate), Federal Reserve (50% Success Rate)
    

-- Robbing Phase --

- Intimidation
    Skill check? or by chance based on partner's strength?
- Lock picking
    Skill check

suggestion: How about every action takes a certain amount of time to complete? Ex: user has 15 min worth of moves, so intimidation takes 30 sec, lock picking takes 2 minutes

First Decision: Front Door (Loud), Back Door (Sneak)

FRONT DOOR
    Bust through the door with partner
    Text choice: "EVERYONE PUT YOUR HANDS UP", "EVERYONE PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN", "GET ON THE GROUND"
    PARTNER: "THIS IS A ROBBERY"
    *Partner's intimidation stat calculation*
    Both of you go to the teller, pointing your guns.
    Action choice: Yell at the bank teller (intimidation), Break through the door (strength)
        YELL at the bank teller
            PLAYER: "GIVE ME ALL THE MONEY"

BACK DOOR
    Sneak through the door with partner
    *Partner's sneak stat calculation*
    PARTNER: "Watch out for the cameras, let me disable them"
    *Partner's intellect stat* 
    PARTNER: "There's a password combination over here, help me solve it."
    Game:
        *Maybe we can make an array with different word combinations that someone has to unscramble*



Second Decision: 

-- Getaway Phase --
