-- Planning Phase --

Decision System (Limited by $):
- Bank
    Amount of $/points possible
- Getaway car and driver 
    Car stats system: speed and durability
- Partner 
    strength and intimidation, intellect and sneak
    _maybe different decisions pop up with either partner_
- Weapon/Tool
  note: I'm really not sure how a weapon choice would play a role

First Decision: Town Bank, Bank of Chase Fargo, Federal Reserve
    

-- Robbing Phase --

- Intimidation
    Skill check? or by chance based on partner's strength?
- Lock picking
    Skill check

suggestion: How about every action takes a certain amount of time to complete? Ex: user has 15 min worth of moves, so intimidation takes 30 sec, lock picking takes 2 minutes

First Decision: Front Door (Loud), Back Door (Sneak)

FRONT DOOR
    Bust through the door with partner
    Text choice: "EVERYONE PUT YOUR HANDS UP", "EVERYONE PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN", "GET ON THE GROUND"
    PARTNER: "THIS IS A ROBBERY"
    *Partner's intimidation stat calculation*
    Both of you go to the teller, pointing your guns.
    Action choice: Yell at the bank teller (intimidation), Break through the door (strength)
        YELL at the bank teller
        



Second Decision: 

-- Getaway Phase --
