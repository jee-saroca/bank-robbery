-- Robbing Phase --

- Intimidation
    Skill check? or by chance based on partner's strength?
- Lock picking
    Skill check

suggestion: How about every action takes a certain amount of time to complete? Ex: user has 15 min worth of moves, so intimidation takes 30 sec, lock picking takes 2 minutes

First Decision: Front Door (Loud), Back Door (Sneak)
